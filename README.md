Hello Guys, In this repository i have performed some of the basic python programing on both numbers and string. I have used IF conditions for displaying the grades and performed some of the arthemetic operations on numbers . All the inputs will be given to the programs from the user itself.

 I have replaced the characters from the string and reverse the resultant string and displayed the output and in another string program i had replaced the words.
 coming to numbers i have performed some arthemetic operationd and also another program will display the grading system of UCM. All the technical part of the codes have been explained well in the above attached video. For the ease of readers comments are also available after every line of the program to get user experience.

 please do check the document and run the programs in python compiler. Refer to the comments in code to know what exactly that code does in the program.

THANK YOU
